class LyricsManager:
    """
    A class to manage and display lyrics for the music player.

    Plannings:
    * Baiscs:
        - Display lyrics in sync with the music playback.
        - Read lyrics files: lrc , txt , srt , etc.
        - Use a library like `lyricsgenius` or `musixmatch` to fetch lyrics

    * Advanced:
        - Support for multiple languages and formats.
        - Display lyrics in a separate window or overlay. // TODO: Implement this in the UI layer.
        - Enable searching for lyrics using the song title and artist name, or use lyrics to search for the song.
        - Save fetched lyrics to a local file for offline access.
    
    * IDEAS:
        - Use OpenAI's Whisper API or OpenAI Whisper Library to transcribe lyrics from audio files.
        - Use a machine learning model to identify the song from the lyrics.
