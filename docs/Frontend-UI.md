# Frontend UI Overview

The Acoustic Player frontend aims to provide a simple, elegant experience based
on Material Design principles. The current implementation is a minimal web page
using Materialize CSS. It serves as a starting point for an eventual Electron
interface.

## Features

- Materialize CSS for modern styling
- Fetches track data from the Flask backend
- Click a track to start playback via the REST API
- Input field to select a folder and trigger a library scan

Future iterations can expand this into a full Electron application with richer
components and animations.
